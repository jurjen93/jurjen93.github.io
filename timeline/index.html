                <p>
                    Currently researching how we can improve the data calibration and imaging pipeline of the LOFAR telescope, such that I can make other astronomers happy and study the evolution of radio galaxies myself.

                    Together with friends we founded the international stuttering organization Stamily. With Stamily we are creating a world-wide community for people who stutter. We organize various types of activities in-person and online. Check out Stamily <a href="https://stamily.org/">here</a>.

                    When Covid-19 hit us in the Netherlands, I was stuck in Iceland for 4 months, as I decided to stay with my girlfriend who lived there.

                <p>
                    Directly after graduating, I started to work at Matrixian Group (where I stayed for 2 years). This is a data science company based in Amsterdam. There, I worked on various data-related projects: developing an address checker for big postal companies, maintaining a machine learning model to predict house prices, creating a test study to use AI to predict mortgage repayments, and more.

                <p>
                    In Leuven (Belgium), I studied <a href="https://www.onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/opleidingen/e/CQ_50536938.htm#activetab=diploma_omschrijving">Space Studies</a> from October 2017 until my graduation in January 2019. This was an advanced interdisciplinary Master's degree, where we had lectures from major players in the space industry, such as Frank De Winne (former astronaut).

                <p>
                    The last 4 months of 2018 I was an intern at ESA. I worked with the Gaia DR2 data and wrote my Master thesis about Benford's law between distances of stars. This became a <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2020/10/aa37256-19.pdf">scientific publication</a> and I published my first scientific article about it <a href="https://jurjendejong.medium.com/benfords-law-in-the-gaia-universe-b5727db7a936">here.</a> This was a great time and the perfect opportunity to meet a lot of space experts around Europe.

                <p>
                    In the summer of 2018, I traveled to Taiwan on a scholarship from the university of Leuven to study Chinese language and culture. Taiwan is an amazing place and I really enjoyed the combination of learning much about the language and culture, while at the same time traveling around the island.

                <p>
                    In September 2017, I wrote my <a href="https://scientias.nl/moet-ruimtevaart-groener/">first popular science article</a> for Scientias. This was picked up well. After this, I wrote <a href="https://scientias.nl/?s=jurjen+de+jong">multiple articles</a> for Scientias. As a result, I have several times been interviewed by journalists from the Netherlands and Belgium. In 2021 I was also cited in <a href="https://www.bol.com/nl/nl/f/iedereen-ruimtevaarder/9300000019014624/">"Iedereen ruimtevaarder"</a>.

                    In the summer of 2017, I went to Tunisia to do an internship on a scholarship from IAESTE. I worked as a mechanical engineer during the week and traveled around the country in the weekend. This was an amazing experience and it taught me much about the Arabic world.

                    In June 2017, I obtained my Master's degree in Mathematics with a specialization in Mathematical Physics & Astronomy at the University of Ghent. This included my exchange to Uppsala. My Master thesis was about the Nuker Model, which can be used to describe the surface brightness profile of galactic nuclei.

                    In the summer of 2015, I decided to move abroad and study in another country. My first stop was Belgium, which was still close to home. But because I lived in an international student house, I experienced for the first time to live in an international environment and to expand my horizons.

                    After 3 years of studying Mathematics and 2 years of Physics, I obtained my Bachelor's degrees in both math and physics at the university of Utrecht (the Netherlands). My Bachelor thesis was about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuktibh%C4%81%E1%B9%A3%C4%81">Gaṇita-yukti-bhāṣā</a>, which is an ancient mathematical astronomy text written in Malayalam but translated to Hindi and later to English.
